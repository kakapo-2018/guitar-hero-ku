- refresh active chord whenever any button is pressed, i.e. remove need for "find chord" button; split the action and use [...state]
- make lightup selection by string/fret grid instead of ID or class
- make functionality for double sharps
- maybe work the two above by selecting the tonic and then finding the rest of the chord by relative position
