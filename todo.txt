Lianna To-Do list
- write function to build a major/minor chord given a tonic and the triad structures. 
-- select the tonic and then find the rest of the chord by relative position
-- use a conditional that won't allow any notes above a certain fret to play (e.g. position one = fret5 or below), add functionality for other positions later
-- use a conditional that won't allow two notes on the same sting (maybe defaulting to the lowest-numbered fret)


* Cmajor has CEG - fine. Start with C3 on string5, add E3 on string 4, G3 on string 3(open), C4 on string 2 and E4 on string 1.

Data: 
major chord is major triad + minor triad,
a minor chord is a minor triad + a maj triad,
dimimnished is two minor triads,
augmented is 2 major triads,
sus skips the third




Concerns: 
* if I build a function to create a Major chord given a tonic, whether it will actually spit out the notes we play for standard position-1 guitar chords.
* The computer has no idea how far fingers can stretch and I don't know if standard finger positions have lots of exceptions to accomodate that.


Maybes, depending on functionality:
- make lightup selection by string/fret grid instead of ID or class
- make functionality for double sharps
