[Intro] 
 C  Em  Am  F
 C  Em  Am  F

C  Em  F
Oooo, oooo, oooo...
C  Em  F
Oooo, oooo, oooo...
 
[Chorus] 
C         Em
Somewhere over the rainbow
F       C
Way up high
F       C
And the dreams that you dream of
G          Am      F
Once in a lullaby...
     C        Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F           C
Blue birds fly
F        C
And the dreams that you dream of
G                     Am    F
Dreams really do come true...
 
[Verse] 
     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star
G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G
High above the chimney tops
       Am           F
That's where you'll find me
 
[Chorus] 
    C         Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F             C
Blue birds fly
F       C
And the dream that you dare to
G               Am   F
Why oh why can't I...
 
[Verse] 
     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star
G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G
High above the chimney tops
       Am           F
That's where you'll find me
 
[Chorus] 
    C         Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F          C
Way up high
F       C
And the dreams that you dare to
G               Am   F
Why oh why can't I
 
[Outro] 
C  Em  F
Oooo, oooo, ooo
C  Em  F
Oooo, oooo, ooo
