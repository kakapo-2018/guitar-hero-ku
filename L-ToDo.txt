--------------------------- Lianna To-Do list  ---------------------------

---------------- Essential ----------------

*! innerHTML change sharps vs flats depending on selected chord
e.g. if state=b, find all with class flat and re-render inner html with Gb, etc

* Rearrange chord key buttons to be in better sub-row collections for screen space arrangement

* Check what dependencies are still actually needed


---------------- Should Have ----------------

* more chord types urls/buttons
e.g. A/C#
* DO NOT ADD PLAYDISPLAY SONGS WE DON'T HAVE CHORDS TO



---------------- Would Be Nice ----------------

* if fret listing is X, return a thing to show muted string, e.g. X in open fret
* refactor most functions into a different file (?)



---------------- Maybe eventually ----------------

* ?? hidden class for #/b divs to be removed only when lit - stretch button to toggle






---------------- Old and/or requires structural changes ----------------

*  ditch API and manually build chords with triads
Write function to build a major/minor chord given a tonic and the triad structures. 

Rule set:
1. lowest note must be tonic
2. array restricted on each string (b-1) highest index
3. one note per string

// Build a major chord given a tonic
// limit to 1 note per string and not above fret 5
// translate sharps and flats
// need to select tonic without sharp/flat interference
// start with thicketst/highest-numbered string, look into first five frets for instance of note. THEN build
// do a test run with selecting any fret and getting it to print off all higher frets in sequential order, ignoring any that are past the fret limit
// still would be nicer if tonal had a way to build by scientific notation

* use a conditional that won't allow any notes above a certain fret to play (e.g. position one = fret5 or below)* add functionality for other positions later
* use a conditional that won't allow two notes on the same sting (maybe defaulting to the lowest-numbered fret)

select the tonic and then find the rest of the chord by relative position

Cmajor has CEG - fine. Start with C3 on string5, add E3 on string 4, G3 on string 3(open), C4 on string 2 and E4 on string 1.

major chord is major triad + minor triad,
a minor chord is a minor triad + a maj triad,
dimimnished is two minor triads,
augmented is 2 major triads,
sus skips the third
etc
